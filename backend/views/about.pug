                p Just like everyone else, I got hooked on Wordle—so I thought, “Why not make my own?” This little project is my homemade version of the internet’s favorite word-guessing game. 
                p Built from scratch with a lot of coffee and questionable variable names, it’s here to give your brain a daily workout (and maybe a few humble pie moments). 
                p Whether you’re a word wizard or just here to kill time, give it a go—and no peeking at the dictionary!
                p.funMessage Have fun guessing the words!
                p.mvh Kind regards, the Wordle-viktornoskire Team
